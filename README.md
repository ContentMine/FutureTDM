# FutureTDM
All materials of the involvement in the [FutureTDM project](http://futuretdm.eu/).

All materials worked out in this repository where conducted within the EU Horizon2020 project **Future TDM - The Future of Text and Data Mining**, an EU Horizon2020 research project with participation of Open Knowledge International and ContentMine.

## DO CONTENT MINING

To do text data mining with the content mine software you need two things:
1. Install the ContentMine software. Find out more in [installation.md](../../blob/master/installation.md).
2. Learn about text data mining. As preparation we recommend to have a look at the resources list in [installation.md](../../blob/master/installation.md).

## TUTORIALS

We worked out three different use-cases to show the power of text data mining with our software.

### Zika Virus

Use text data mining to get an overview on the research around the zika virus. How did the research field evolve in the last decades? What authors and journals contributed most and how are they connected? and and dive into the data/publications to get a better understanding, on the state of it and have a look at the species mentioned.

**Go to the [Zika Tutorial](tutorials/zika).**

### P-Hacking

(soon to come...)

### Systematic Literature Review (Train the Trainees for Librarians)

Filter out and find relevant publications, to support you doing a systematic review around your research question - in a fully open and reproducible way.

**Go to the [Systematic Literature Review Tutorial](tutorials/systematic-literature-review).**
