### Introduction into text data mining with ContentMine

In this session, we will give an introduction into text and data mining and the [ContentMine](http://contentmine.org) project. This includes the basic concept of TDM, legal issues, TDM with scholarly literature and use-cases. There will also be time for questions.

### Workshop

In the hands-on workshop, we will give a basic insight on how to use text data mining techniques and the ContentMine software to help librarians with the systematic literature review.

**Requirements**

To be able to let the software run on your own laptop and do everything by yourself during the workshop, you need a running installation of our ContentMine software. To reduce the risks of bandwith problems during download or installation errors, we recommend to install the software in advance and test it shortly (start the virtual machine or use a software package in your command line), if it is running.
- Install the needed ContentMine software. You have two options. 
	- Use our virtual machine image ([download](), where everything is running and pre-configured. This is a out of the box solution and is especially recommended for non-tech-savy people. You can find more information how to setup the virtual machine [here](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/tree/master/software-tutorials/vms).
	- [install the software locally](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM#option-1-install-software-locally-recommended)
- bring your laptop with power supply

**Do some more text data mining**

Here a collection of resources, to keep text data mining going after the introductory workshop.

- [pyCProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/pyCProject): if you want to analyse the mined facts in Python, you should install our Python wrapper for the [CProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/cproject/README.md).
- do our [software tutorials](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/tree/master/software-tutorials): this helps you to get used to our tools. The needed ones are:
	- [getpapers](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/getpapers/README.md)
	- [norma](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/norma/README.md)
	- [ami](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/ami/README.md)

- You should also take a look at our [tutorials section](../../tutorials) in this repo. So far, we have another really interesting one about how to use text data mining to understand more about the [Zika virus](../../tutorials/zika).
- To keep up to date and explore the full knowledge base we have, visit our website [contentmine.org](http://contentmine.org/) and our [GitHub account](https://github.com/ContentMine). 


## CONTRIBUTION
