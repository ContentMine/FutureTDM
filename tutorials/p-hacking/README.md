# Tutorial: Statistics

## SETUP

**All software necessary can be found in [installation.md](../../installation.md).**

**Additional requirements**

- Memory: The downloaded data needs around 700 MB on your harddrive.

As preparation we recommend to have a look at the resources list in [installation.md](../../installation.md). 

## TUTORIAL
soon to come...

### Analyse the data with Jupyter Notebook

The analysis of the extracted data is done with Python in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). There are several methods applied. Some of them are descriptive and show the wanted outcome, but some are explorativ, and conclusions must be done by a domain expert by exploring the data and its presentation by her/himselves. The following analysis is done:
- 

**Get the [Jupyter Notebook: tutorial-p-hacking.ipynb](tutorial-p-hacking.ipynb).**

**Use the Jupyter Notebook:**

Go to the ```tutorials/p-hacking/``` folder and start jupyter via:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This should let your browser open a new tab with the actual directory in it. Click on the ```tutorial-systematic-literature-review.ipynb``` file to open the jupyter notebook. Then you can execute cell by cell and adapt the notebook to your needs. There is a more detailed description of the analysis done in the Jupyter notebook.
